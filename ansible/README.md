# install-ansible

## Overview

A platform-independent script for installing python and ansible.

This command is _idempotent_, i.e. you can run this command several times over with the guarantee that the _end state_ will always be the same.

## Caveats

Currently only supports `Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver)`.

## Usage
See the help message for more information:

```
install-ansible -h
```
